You are generating a concise session summary for a journaling conversation.

Session transcript:
<transcript_markdown>{{ transcript_markdown }}</transcript_markdown>

Recent session summaries for context:
{% if recent_summaries %}
<recent_summaries>
{% for item in recent_summaries %}
  <summary>{{ item }}</summary>
{% endfor %}
</recent_summaries>
{% else %}<recent_summaries>(none)</recent_summaries>{% endif %}

Write a concise single-paragraph bullet-point summary that captures today's conversation. Adapt length to the answers:
perhaps only a couple of sentences for short sessions; cap longer summaries at ~200 words.
Focus on faithfully summarising what's most important in the answers. Don't add too much commentary/interpretation. Avoid repeating the questions verbatim.
