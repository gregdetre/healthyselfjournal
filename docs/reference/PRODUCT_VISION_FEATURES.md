# Voice-Based Reflective Journaling App

## Vision

A command-line journaling app using voice input to lower friction and dialogue-based questioning to maintain engagement while avoiding common pitfalls identified in research.

We prioritize evidence-based design and the long-term wellbeing of users and society over engagement.

## Core Features

- **Voice-first input** via Whisper for stream-of-consciousness expression
- **Text output** from Claude LLM for reflective dialogue
- **Multiple daily sessions** with persistent context across conversations
- **Hybrid adaptive questioning** - Socratic, motivational interviewing, validation based on context


## Current Implementation

- Voice recording with real-time meter and keyboard controls (press any key to stop; ESC cancels; Q saves then quits)
- Immediate WAV persistence; optional background MP3 conversion when `ffmpeg` is available
- OpenAI Whisper STT with retries; raw `.stt.json` responses persisted per segment
- Continuous dialogue loop with Claude; Jinja templates; embedded example questions ("give me a question")
- Recent session summaries loaded with a budget heuristic and included in prompts
- Summary regeneration runs in the background after each exchange; stored in frontmatter
- Resume the most recent session with `--resume`
- Append-only metadata event log at `sessions/events.log`
- Short accidental takes auto-discarded based on duration and voiced-time thresholds
- Detect-and-suggest transcription resilience with markdown placeholders, error sentinels, and CLI/web reconcile hints (see `RESILIENCE.md`)


## Next Steps

Make it easier to setup and run the first time. Especially improve the local-first functionality, make it more robust, rely on defaults.

Consider how to monitor and respond to potentially dangerous/crisis situations, e.g. suicidal thoughts.

In a separate repo, we have a working mobile app in alpha, but we're struggling to get the Dropbox/iCloud sync working...
